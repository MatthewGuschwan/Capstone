Word Oracle application on the Shiny platform.

Natural Language Processing.

Matthew Guschwan

To use this application, the user must type in a word or phrase into the text box.  The application will then guess the next word in the phrase.

The algorithm that generates the guess essentially relies on how often word combinations (ngrams) appeared in a relativel large sample of text taken from blogs, twitter and news sources (for more detail, see:  ).

The algorithm is written in the R programming language and hosted on the Shiny server platform.
